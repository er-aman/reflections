How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you 
see the bug that was introduced?
After viewing the difference you get to know what has been changed while comparing two different files
and thus you get to know the bug which was introduced
and can change it by looking into the changed file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
you get to know the features which have been removed 
and on later stage if you wish to include those features
you get the functionality of doing that from there.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

becuase Git is focused to code segment only
and its better to keep the track of all the 
files related to code. while others have file based 
saving thus they don't give it that much heed and treat 
them as separate files.
