What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize the repository it shows up the head and the untracked 
records of the file. we need to do this because it would help us to check 
which files we have to work with.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

 staging area is the intermediate area between the working direcory and 
 repository, which is used to include the files one by one which needs
 to be committed in one go in the form of bundle.

 one can commit the different realted files alltogather in a single go.
